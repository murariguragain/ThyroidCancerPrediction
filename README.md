# ðŸ§¬ Thyroid Cancer Prediction Using Data Mining Techniques

This project explores the use of machine learning to predict thyroid cancer types from patient medical data. Using a dataset of **383 patient records** (age, gender, tumor stage, pathology, risk factors, etc.), multiple models were trained and evaluated.

## Key Highlights
- Applied **Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Logistic Regression, Neural Network** and more.  
- **Random Forest and Gradient Boosting** achieved the highest accuracy and robustness.  
- Identified **Pathology, Tumor Stage, Gender, and Age** as the most influential predictors.  
- Demonstrated the feasibility of ML for **early diagnosis and treatment planning**.  

## Future Improvements
- Add benign cases for binary classification.  
- Incorporate hormonal test data (TSH, T3, FT4).  
- Apply hyperparameter tuning and deep learning approaches.
